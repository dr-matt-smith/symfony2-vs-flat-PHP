symfony2-vs-flat-PHP
====================

a version of incrementally transforming a flat PHP app to one using Symfony2

a version of the argument for learening Symfony2 from:
http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/from_flat_php_to_symfony2.html

but with a bit of routing/URI tidying up, so that the versions for each step can be used from sub-directories off the webroot, withouh having to resort to virtual servers etc.
