symfony2-vs-flat-PHP
====================

## About
a version of incrementally transforming a flat PHP app to one using Symfony2

a version of the argument for learening Symfony2 from:
http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/from_flat_php_to_symfony2.html

but with a bit of routing/URI tidying up, so that the versions for each step can be used from sub-directories off the webroot, without having to resort to virtual servers etc.

## Setting up the DB
I've followed the same DB structure as in the Symfony2 pages
DB name is: blog_db

the file '[db.sql](db.sql)' contains the SQL to setup the DB you need

create a DB user with privileges to this database - in my examples I use the following username / password:
username: fred
password: smith
